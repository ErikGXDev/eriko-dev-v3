This post is about how I added a blog into my website using the Javascript framework Astro.

# What's Astro?

Astro is an open-source web framework. It's focused on performance and is useful for content-heavy websites like blogs, documentation or portfolios!
Like Next.js, Sveltekit, Nuxt and SolidStart, Astro has its own single-file components and handles the build process for you.

Another cool thing about Astro is that you can mix multiple UI frameworks together! You can use Svelte, React and Vue components all in one page. And because Astro outputs zero Javascript by default, the bundle size does not increase either. Each component gets turned into static HTML-

# Creating the blog

Because I didn't have much experience in creating a blog in Astro (it was my first time actually), I decided to look up some blog templates, to see their implementation.
I soon found a fitting design - [Astro Paper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/).

It had everything I needed: pagination and a working blog system. So I did what every programmer can do best - copying and pasting as much of the code as possible.
To my suprise, I only had to change a few things to get a result I was happy with. Of course I changed the UI to fit my website and such (I'm not a _total_ copycat).

# After-word

Creating this blog definetly was a lot of fun and I really learned a lot of things about Astro and its features on the way. For example, [Astro collections](https://docs.astro.build/de/guides/content-collections/) were something I have never know about before, but this was a great oppertunity to learn more about them.
